## Photo Caption Formula:

Each photo should include:
- **Location specificity**: "in Old Town Auburn", "at Foresthill Bridge"
- **Activity context**: "steps from restaurants", "offers sunset views"
- **Auburn connection**: always mention Auburn or specific Auburn landmark

Examples:
- ✅ "Historic hotels in Old Town Auburn offer Victorian charm steps from restaurants and trails"
- ✅ "The American River carves through Auburn's canyon, offering world-class recreation"
- ❌ "Beautiful hotel room" (too generic)
- ❌ "Scenic mountain views" (could be anywhere)
